							<li> Make sure you eat before you come in for your appointment.</li>
							<li> The area that you want to recieve a tattoo on must be clean.</li>
							<li> We recommend that if the area you want to tattoo is prone to dry skin, that for a few days following up 
							to your appointment use an exfoliating body wash and try to remove as much dead/dry skin as possible.</li>
							<li> If you are sick please call to reschedule your appointment.</li>
							<li> Make sure you have any reference materials printed out and ready for you artist.</li>
							<li> Make sure you show up to your appointment on time. Keep in mind that your tattoo artist could be running
							behind or ahead of schedule. Be considerate if you have to wait a little bit.</li>
							<li> We do not recommend that you drink a lot of caffeine before your tattoo because it can thin your blood.</li>
							<li> We also don't recomend that you take ibuprofen or advil prior to getting a tattoo because it also thins your blood.</li>
							<li> UNDER NO CONDITION WILL WE TATTOO YOU IF YOU ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL OR ANY OTHER DRUGS</li>

				<h2 class = "careHeading">After A Tattoo</h2>
					 <p>
						<ul class = "careList">
							<li> We will bandage your tattoo after completing it.
							You can remove the bandage 4-6 hours after leaving the tattoo shop.</li>
							<li> Before touching your tattoo WASH YOUR HANDS!</li>
							<li> When you're removing your bandage if it is stuck to your tatoo
							get in the shower and let the water soak the bandage. This will help 
							the bandage seperate from the tattoo.</li>
							<li> Gently wash your tattoo with a mild, unscented soap and warm water.
							We recommend using Dial antibacterial unscented soap.</li>
							<li> After washing your tattoo you can either pat it dry with a paper towel or 
							the better option is to let it air dry. NEVER use bath towels because they harbor bacteria.</li>
							<li> A half hour after washing your tattoo apply a thin layer of A&D Ointment.</li>
							<li> Repeat washing and applying ointment 4 times a day for the first 2 days.</li>
							<li> Your tattoo may scab up and start to peel. LEAVE IT ALONE! DON'T PEEL OR SCRATCH YOUR TATTOO.</li>
							<li> After 2-3 days, stop washing your tattoo. Begin applying Lubriderm or Curel lotion as needed to keep your tattoo moist.</li>
							<li> Continue applying lotion as needed until your tattoo has completely healed and has stopped peeling.</li>
							<li> If pimples appear in the area where the ointment is applied, DO NOT pop them. Stop using the ointment.</li>
							<li> DO NOT expose your tattoo to direct sunlight until it is FULLY healed. If so, it may fade your tatoo.</li>
							<li> DO NOT use sunblock until your tattoo has completely healed.</li>
							<li> DO NOT go swimming, at all, until your tattoo has completely healed!</li>
							<li> DO NOT scratch your tattoo. Slap it if it itches.</li>
							<li> DO NOT pick any scabs that may form; they will fall off on their own. Picking them will result in 
							discoloration and/or scarring</li>
							<li>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR NEW TATTOO, PLEASE DONT'T HESITATE TO CALL.</li>
							<li> BUT ABOVE ALL, ENJOY YOUR NEW TATTOO!</li>
